simple_navigation_goals
===============================================================================================================================

The only difference between the main.cpp and the main_task1.cpp/main_task2.cpp are the outcommented waypoints of the other task.

That means that in main_task1.cpp the waypoint-setting of task 2 is outcommented and in main_task2.cpp vice versa.

The package simple_navigation_goals only uses the file main.cpp. The main_task1.cpp/main_task2.cpp are only in this directory for fast changing between the tasks by replacing the main.cpp with the appropriate file.
